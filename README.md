##Boosting Brain-inspired Path Integration Efficiency via Learning-based Replication of Continuous Attractor Neurodynamics 

Since we were not working on SLAM tasks from the beginning, we excluded LCD, as it does not fall within the scope of this research topic. The removal of the LCD component from NeuroSLAM was to use it as a baseline for comparison in DR tasks, rather than comparing this work (which is DR-oriented) within the context of SLAM tasks.
In fact, during our experiments, we identified and verified an important issue. Brain-inspired SLAM based on CANN is significantly affected by parameter tuning. If the energy injected by the LCD strategy based on visual template matching is insufficient due to improper parameter tuning, or if the number of injections is extremely low due to re-identification failures, the contribution of the LCD module to the state modulation of navigation cells becomes negligible. In such cases, the brain-inspired SLAM algorithm essentially only serves the function of DR. For more details on this phenomenon, you can refer to the Python version of NeuroSLAM publicly released by the author Xu He, which has been rigorously benchmarked against the original MATLAB version of NeuroSLAM, for detailed debugging tests. The link is as follows: https://github.com/BINUCOE/OpenNeuroSLAM
Nevertheless, considering that both of you are interested in the feasibility of integrating LCD into this work, we have chosen to demonstrate the effects of embedding LCD functionality within this work. The specific description is as follows:
During the parameter tuning process, we observed that parameters significantly impact brain-inspired SLAM based on CANN. If parameters are not properly set, the energy injected by the LCD strategy based on visual template matching becomes negligible, causing the entire navigation cell module to merely function as DR. Taking the parking lot dataset as an example, we used the original parameters and recorded the head direction decoding with and without energy injection, then plotted the results for comparison, as shown in Figure 1.

<p align="center">Fig. 1. Comparison of decoding performance of HDCN under different conditions</p>
During the entire dataset run, the energy injection was triggered 535 times, and the cumulative decoded index difference was 33.2. Given the periodic nature of HDCN and the total dimension of 36, this decoded difference is equivalent to 2.8, corresponding to a final angular difference of 28°. The average angular correction per energy injection is merely 0.052°. 
Moreover, our tests revealed that in the vast majority of cases, the number of effective continuous energy injections during each loop closure rarely exceeds 30. This indicates that the cumulative angular correction distributed among multiple spatial experience nodes is capped at a maximum of 1.56°, which is extremely minimal and often imperceptible in the visual representation of the map or trajectory.
In summary, although the cumulative angular difference is significant, the energy injection strategy does not provide sufficient correction to the current pose in practical operation. This means that the presence or absence of LCD did not affect the path integration trajectory results we plotted at all.

Additionally, due to the differences between the computational paradigms of ANN and CANN, we adopted a more compromised method to achieve an approximate LCD effect. We calculated a correction vector based on the difference vector between the current decoded value and the historical decoded value using a fitting function, which directly acts on the current decoded value to provide correction. The correction intensity generated by different historical decoded values, centered on the current decoded value, is shown in a heatmap, as depicted in Figure 2.
From this figure, we can infer that the central offset strength exhibits isotropy, meaning the offset strength is only related to the difference between the historical decoded value and the current decoded value. Based on this conclusion, we conducted a fitting, and the fitting result is shown in Figure 3.

 <p align="center">Fig. 3. The impact of energy injection distance on central offset strength</p>
The values on both the X-axis and Y-axis here refer to changes in indices. Through fitting, we have implemented an approximate LCD strategy for ANN, and experimental results have shown that this strategy does not have a negative impact on brain-inspired SLAM. 
Considering that the experimental process described above is derived from the analysis of the original NeuroSLAM results, the strategy mentioned above transforms the original method of injecting energy into navigation cells (which is highly affected by parameterization) into directly adjusting the decoded values of navigation cells (target-oriented). Although this fully demonstrates that this work can be coupled with LCD based on visual template matching after parameter optimization, this method still does not eliminate the high dependence on parameter tuning. Meanwhile, the introduction of the LCD component actually did not contribute to modifying the DR trajectories depicted in the manuscript
